Are LLM's conscious? There's a lot of chatter about it on LinkedIn,
and I'm occasionally surprised to hear that the idea of a conscious
LLM is absurd because LLMs are mechanistically nothing like the
the consciousness of human brains. Because, well, neuroscience has
no idea how consciousness works! The front-running theory of
consciousness for the past two decades has been Gulio Tononi's
Integrated Information Theory, and although it doesn't have any
major competitors, it's not universally accepted. Nowhere close.

If we don't have a unified theory of consciousness, what do we have?
A large number of experiments that tell us discrete facts _about_
consciousness. Many of them deviate from the intuitions we have
about consciousness from our own introspection.

In this post I'd like to give you a bit of what neuroscience knows
about consciousness, and to convince you that the right attitude
to have about consciousness in LLMs is cautious agnosticism.

## Warmup - Brain Transplants

Let's warm up your own consciousness with a thought experiment.
You've worked out the formula for cold fusion! Driving to the lab
in your excitement to share the results, you crash into another car.

You and your victim are in bad shape. The doctors tell you they're
all set up to do the world's first brain transplant. One body and one brain are going to go home tonight, the others unfortunately won't. They just need to know one thing - would you rather be the
brain donor or the brain recipient?

Putting aside altruism for a moment, what's the selfish choice?
It's to be the donor, of course. "You" are the brain, more than
the rest of the body, so it's more appropriate to think of this
operation as a body-and-face transplant, rather than a brain
transplant, since your identity certainly moves with your brain.
If you took the other choice and accepted a brain donation,
contratulations, your wonderful body lives on, but "you" aren't
here to appreciate that fact. Oh, and that cold fusion formula
is gone, too.

## Warmup - Fragmented Consciousness, Constructed Continuity

One thing we know about consciousness is that it is discontinuous.
Although you experience yourself as existing smoothly through
every point in time that you are awake, your true conscious
experiences are deceptively fragmented. Visual illusions, transcratial magnetic stimulation studies and brain
wave recordings suggest that we experience new percpepts 4-20
times a second. Each percept may embed the sense of motion
of objecects in your visual scene, but your conscious "frame rate"
is much lower (4Hz) than the frame rate available to the sensors
in your eyes (~200Hz).
But the sense of continuity of conscious experience was reconstcuted
by your brain after the fact.

If that's hard to swallow, notice that post-hoc reconstruction
is extremely common. It's easy to verify visually. Observe your
surroundings and get a sense of how clearly you see the room
you're in. How many doors can you see? How many people, books?
These are easy questions to answer.
Now, pick a single object, and don't force your eyes
to stay glued to it for 20 seconds. While locked on to that one
object, how much detail is still available to you? What I hope
you experience from this exercise is the difference between
intuition and reality for our perceptions. When our eyes move
freely, we get the impression that we have high-definition access
to the whole visual field. But when our eyes are stuck in place,
we recognize that only a tiny part of our visual field contains
useful information. The perception of full-field high resolution
is an illusion created after the fact through sensory memory.

## Soul Transplants and Identity

Even if consciosness exists in discrete chunks, what can we
say about how those chunks relate to one another? Another of
our core native beliefs about consciousness is that it's
"continuous" in the sense of extending through time - it's the
"same" conscious being that exists from moment to moment, maybe
not "continuously" in sense of being not-chunked, but at least
persistent and linked from chunk to chunk.

Let's scrutinize this view though, with a thought experiment.
Assume the existence of a soul. Your soul is your consciousness,
and it is the thing links together your chunks of consciousness
into a narrative sequence. However, in this hypothetical, we are
still neuroscientists and we still recognize that physiological
things like synaptic strength and neuron dynamics are the
physical basis of both long-term, short-term and perceptual memory.

Now imagine that conscious soul could hop between bodies - trade
places for a moment with another soul and see through another's
eyes. What would this feel like?

The answer depends on parameter that I haven't specified, and which
you might not have questioned: are physiological processes the only
form or memory, or does the soul posess its own memory system that
is somehow either complementary or redundant with physiological
memory?

If all memory is physical, but there is a soul that experiences,
swapping souls would feel exactly like: _nothing_. When your
soul hops into a new body, it also hops into the existing _memories_,
and when your soul returns to your body, it once again encounters
only your body's memories, carrying none of the other body's memories
back with it.

In this magical trip to another brain and back, there wouldn't a
single trace.

Now, if your soul somehow does have its own memory system, which
is somehow either complementary or redundant with the physical
memory systems, you would remember.

The point of this thought experiment isn't to imagine souls or to
work out whether they have memory. It's to point out how fragmented
our consciousness is, and how differently it exists, compared to
the two forms of continuity that we tacitly assume to be the
essential aspects of consciousness.

When you fully internalize this model, you may feel that you
have no more moral obligation to yourself than you do to any
other human. The fragment of consciousness is no the same
consciousness as the frament that exists right now. It's a new
fragment that exists in the same physical body and has access
to the same set of memories.

## A Von-Neuman model of consciousness

In this state of accepting consciousness as an essentially
discontinuous thing, only _appearing_ smooth due to sensory
reconstruction and continuous moment-to-moment because of physical
memory, we can draw an analogy between human consciousness and
the von Neuman model of computation.

Consciousnes is bracketed into clock cycles. On every cycle,
it "starts cold" in the sense of having no non-physical memory,
rather it is dropped into a preexisting mode of long-term and
short-term memories. Just like your hypothetical soul inserted
into a new body experiences no shock of finding itself in a new
body. Consciousness is the logic processor in the CPU. Each clock
cycle it processes the instructions and manipulates the memory
in its registers and its RAM. The memory system is completely
separate from it and is the only thing providing continuity from
cycle to cycle.

Or for a different metaphor with the same flavor, consciousness
is the agentic LLM API. Every request you make encounteres a
fresh system. Continuity is supplied through the API request via
context engineering. It makes no difference at all if your first
agentic API request goes to a server farm in us-east-1 and the
following one goes to a server farm in jp-1. Neither the model
nor you can tell the difference.
