An old epilepsy treatment involved cutting all the connections between
the two halves of a patient's brain, to prevent seizures in one side
from spreading to the other side. These patients, called "split-brain"
patients, [^split-brain] exhibited behavior that had bizarre
implications for our view of consciousness, but also introduced a
paradox. The paradox goes away if you invite a stranger into your head.
Let me explain.

The original interesting finding in split-brain patients is that they
can not integrate information across the halves of their brain. If you present one
side of the brain with the number 5 (by flashing a 5 on one side of
a screen), and then present the other side of the brain with the number
2 (by flashing it on the other side), the patient will not
be able to add the two numbers together. However, each side of the brain
**does** know the number. The left side of the brain contains the speech
centers and can verbally report its number 5. The other side of the brain
can report its number by writing it on a piece of paper.
There are other setups that show the independence of the two split brain
halves. For example one patient was presented with the word "Texas" at
the non-verbal half of his brain, and the corresponding hand began to
draw a cowboy hat. When asked why, the verbal side of his brain (which
did not have access to the presented word "Texas") could only guess.
**It is as though there are two independent consciousnesses inside the
same body**, if you assume that consciousness is always present in
someone speaking, writing or drawing.

But this strange conclusion comes with an immediate paradox. Split-brain
patients appear socially normal. They don't appear like two minds sharing
a body and wrestling with each other for control. If there is a second
consciousness trapped inside, unable to talk but able to draw, wouldn't
it get out, or try to make itself known in some way? The second
consciousness is surprisingly docile. (There are some exceptions to this,
cases where two motives _do_ seem to fight, in patients with damage
to the connection between the brain halves[^alien-hand], but I am here
focusing on the cases of split-brain patients in which this does
not happen).

How can we resolve the paradox? In my earlier post on
[Consciousness and AI](/posts/ai-consciousness/) I described a model
called "Saltatory Consciousness", which is important for the rest of
my argument here. In that model, consciousness arises at
brief instants only a few times per second, even though we perceive
consciousness to exist continuously. And the post explored a
thought experiment involving the swapping of souls into other brains,
and concluded that the soul (if it existed and could swap), would not
notice the swap, because all memory comes from the brain. The new soul
would inhabit the new brain and its memories
without skipping a beat. And if it swapped back, it would have no idea
that any swapping had happened.

In the spirit of accepting this type of "ignorance" within a moment
of consciousness to everything other than what's in physical memory,
we can find a solution to the paradox of split-brain patients not
experiencing their second consciousness trying to lash out and make
itself known.

There is no paradox, and no need to lash out, if the split brain
case is similar to the non-split-brain case. If we all have multiple
consciousness. The multiple consciousness don't compete or even sense
each other because consciousness is ignorant of everything except the
physical, biological memory. Each of our consciousnesses, if there are
multiple, share the same memories and are conscious only of the singular
body - and each makes the logical fallacy that it too is singular.

So the split brain patient's newly independent consciousness doesn't lash
out, because from its perspective nothing really changed after the split-brain
surgery, except for each side acquiring a complementary form
of hemineglect [^hemineglect]. The second consciousness was there all along,
in other words, and of course by extension it's there in you, too.

What do you think, could it be so crowded upstairs?
