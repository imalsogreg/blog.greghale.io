Work in progress

- Unremarkable soul-swapping
- Reduced continuity of sense of self across time
- Resolution of some who's-who paradoxes
- Substrate independence for self-perpetuation
- Reduced complaint of "but it wouldn't be me" (because even
  your current self "isn't you" in the way you thought)
