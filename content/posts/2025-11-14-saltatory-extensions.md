The way an instant can carry the _sense_ of a whole interval inside
solves the paradox you may sometimes feel when first waking up from
a nap: the feeling that a dream has been going on for a very long
time when you've only been sleeping a short while. There is no
paradox because every instant of consciousness carries the
reconstructed perception of an interval. In dreaming those
reconstructed intervals may simply be longer. Rather than a faithful
reconstruction of the world, the dreaming brain reconstructs
_everything_, and is free to put arbitrary **duration tags** on the
other arbitrary object identity and narrative data it is
constructing.
