Outline (to delete)
We want to know how consciousness works.
It's impossible to know how it works, and to imagine how knowing could come.
The impossibility drives social dynamics in the field.
What we can do anyway.

# Introduction

You're applying to grad school for a Neuroscience program. 

Have you wished you could live forever? You probably have, although you may have
pushed that wish away by imagining some of the unpleasant consequences of
_actually_ living forever. But wait a minute - haven't you wished that you
could live forever without those bad consequences? Or have you wished for
Earth to be visited by benevolent aliens, so that we could talk to them about
the amazing differences between Earth and their home planet, or between
their biology and ours?

These are spiritual yearnings. They come from the same place place where
religious ecstasy comes from, even if they feel to you like they're more
grounded in reality. We yearn to be more fully connected with the world,
to see and understand the full extent of it. We want to be symbolic beings,
free from the limitations of our fragile bodies and short life-spans. As
Ernest Becker describes in Denial of Death[^denial_of_death], this is
our core subconscious motivation, and the hopelessness of escaping the
reality of our fragile bodies is our core repression.

To an early neuroscience student, there is a glimmer of hope. It's the hope
of understanding how consciousness works. Understanding consciousness means
being able to answer
