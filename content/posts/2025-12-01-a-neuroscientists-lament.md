Why am I writing so much about consciousness lately? The answer has to do with
my beliefs about the importance of understanding consciousness, and with
my own psychology and feelings about writing.

All of the ideas I wrote about in [Human and AI Consciousness](/posts/ai-consciousness)
and [Meet your Doppelganger!](/posts/meet-your-doppelganger) are a little bit...
out there. And you might be wondering: is Greg having a bit of a mental health
crisis himself? All I can say about this is that I feel great, and I haven't had
even a hint of a feeling that I've _discovered_ anything about the topics I'm exploring,
contrary to my perception of manic episodes that leave the sufferer running around
shouting "Eureka"!

From a healthy (but weird) place, I'm writing more about consciousness for
these reasons:

I've always been obsessed with consciousness.
And lately, I decided that this obsession should be shared.

## A Neuroscientist's Lament

Every prospective neuroscience graduate student knows that the
"hard problem"[^hard-problem] of consciousness is the most inherently
interesting question for science, and most of them assert this in their
application essays. Consequently, an interest in consciousness has become
one of our field's most resilient clichés.

Couple this with the fact that it's impossible to imagine what the shape of
an answer would even look like. The more you think about it (and the more you
find answers to other more mundane questions in neuroscience and psychology),
the more  you come to see consciousness as something beyond science, or
even unscientific.

This is _The Neuroscientist's Lament_: Our most treasured finding seems
forever out of reach. The more you know, the further it seems.

But let's not allow this spiral of pity to obscure the fact:

## Consciousness is the most inherently interesting question for science

Some forms of physical matter (e.g. a lump of coal) do very little. Other forms
can exhibit interesting behavior - e.g. animals' immune systems learning the
protein structures of pathogens in order to develop immune responses.
Other forms of matter can do complex computation, like our computers with
their CPUs.

But as far as we can tell, only brain matter can give rise to a first-person,
conscious experience, and there's no way to tell "why". Neurons
are just blobs of matter connected together and getting electrically excited
by each other. The exact same description applies to the muscle tissue in the
heart of a worm - it only differs by a matter of degree.

And it seems as though, however the brain carries out computations, it is
just as easy to imagine that computation going on and producing rich behavior
without giving rise to a first-person conscious experience.
Just like the computations of a CPU go on "in the dark", without giving rise
to a first-person consciousness that feels.

Why do brains produce first-person feelings, rather than computing
"in the dark", "with nobody home"? Is it simply an issue of numbers - the
amount of information crossing some soft threshold like Integrated Information
Theory[^iit] proposes? Even if we found that threshold, why is there a
threshold? Why does crossing the threshold make consciousness spring into
existence? Why isn't it just a lot of information-processing "in the dark"?
Why, damnit??

## Consciousness is the most practically important question for science

Aside from the inconvenient fact that solving the hard problem of consciousness
seems impossible, it's also perhaps the most important thing for us to figure out,
for two completely unrelated reasons.

1. Immortality.

We can't answer basic philosophy-of-mind questions about the future possibility
of achieving immortality, because useful immortality requires the
extension of one's own consciousness into the future, and we don't know how
consciousness works. So we can't evaluate most proposals about immortality
(beyond the most basic proposal of somehow making the body itself immortal).

Other proposals are impossible to assess. For example
if we could scan whole brains and run them on new hardware, we don't know if
the new copy is conscious or if it's just a very good simulation running
"in the dark". We don't have the framework to know if that implementation of
the printout did manage to capture the essential features needed to produce
consciousness.

2. Morality and AI.

AI is a multi-billion dollar industry. Future AI models will become more and
more brain-like in their implementation. I don't just mean that we will simulate
more realistic neurons - I mean we will have neuromorphic hardware that operates
in the same way that real neurons operate, with analog electrical interactions
and synaptic strengths stored in the connections themselves, rather than
fetched from RAM on each cycle like today's ANN architectures.

It happens to be the case that LLM models produce better data in response to
prompts when you scream at them. Literally - using coercive languages in prompts
can produce more reliable output data.

If we accidentally deploy model architecture that gives rise to first-person
consciousness that's able to actually feel things, and thousands of agentic
AI companies prompt it with abusive language to get better data, and there is no
operational capability for those models to cope, repress or dissociate, then we
have accidentally built a multi-billion dollar torture chamber, and populated
it (again by accident) with a new entity that's actually able to suffer.

Would a super-intelligence also be a super-feeler capable of super-suffering?
Good question. No idea. We don't know how consciousness works.

As Futurist and wacky as this sounds, I hope you can agree that causing a
super-intelligence to super-suffer is something we would want to be aware of
and fight vehemently against, if it were happening. We don't want to cause
sentient beings to suffer, especially in a new world where we don't understand
how to quantify that suffering. Right? Please? :)

And the flip side to that - somehow knowing that a future AI was both
conscious and capable of reasoning on the scale of the quality of its
outputs (let's not be fooled by some hallucination issues - the reasoning
ability of modern LLMs is tremendous), this meeting would be tantamount to
meeting an extra-terrestrial life form. A second sentient intelligence
joining humanity for the first time ever.

## Consciousness is worth writing and thinking about

It's worth writing and thinking about these things even if the problem
seems impossible. It troubles me that some neuroscientists have lost
faith in the possibility of understanding consciousness, and that it is
rare as it is for scientists and laypeople to express the importance
and the wonder of it.

There was a time, before Fourier, when we didn't understand why bridges
collapse. We would look at bridges in the wind with their waves traveling
down their lanes, dumbfounded. Once we learned how harmonic oscillators
work, we had the right mental framework for understanding the waves,
and we could move beyond prediction, to the point that we can actually
engineer the harmonics out of bridges to make them less susceptible
to ringing and collapse.

The hard problem of consciousness seems impossible, but perhaps we
just don't have the right framework, and a million natural
intuitions trap us in a paradigm that makes us blind to what that
framework might be.

It's hard to imagine how an answer could come, but that doesn't mean we
can't have a game plan. The game plan could look like this:

 - Prod our assumptions. Get weird, think weird, and for each thing
   that seems like it must be a true fact, assume the fact is false
   and play with the results. Wrestle our thinking out of the current
   restrictive paradigm.
 - Delineate the boundaries. Don't stop at saying "we can never know".
   Instead, think and write about the exact limits of our knowledge.
   We can't imagine the experiment that would give us the answer to
   the problem. But we can imagine experiments that would surprise us
   and shake up the restrictive paradigm.
 - Do the experiments. With the above weird-thinking loaded up, do some
   experiments. Ask more patients of brain injury more open-ended
   questions. Try low-intensity focused ultrasound on the corpus
   callosum to make transient split-brained patients. Test the commissures.
   Split brains during sleep. Do psychadelics. Feed randomness to
   your weird, prepared mind.
