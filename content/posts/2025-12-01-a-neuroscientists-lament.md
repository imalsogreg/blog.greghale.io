Why am I writing so much about consciousness lately? The answer has to do with
my beliefs about the importance of understanding consciousness, and also with
my own psychology and feelings about writing.

All of the ideas I wrote about in [Human and AI Consciousness](/posts/ai-consciousness)
and [Meet your Doppelganger!](/posts/meet-your-doppelganger) are a little bit...
out there. And you might be wondering: is Greg having a bit of a mental health
crisis himself? All I can say about this is that I feel great, and I haven't had
even a hint of a feeling that I've _discovered_ anything about the topics I'm exploring,
contrary to my perception of manic episodes that leave the sufferer running aronud
shouting "Eureka"! If I were unhealthy, surely I'd feel like I have it all figured out.

From a healthy (but weird) place, I'm writing more about consciousness for
these two reasons:

(1) I've always been obsessed with consciousness.
And (2), lately I decided that this obsession should be shared.

# The Neuroscientist's Lament

Every prospective neuroscience graduate student knows that the
"hard problem"[^hard-problem] of consciousness is the most inherently
interesting question for science, and most of them assert this in their
application essays. Consequently, an interest in consciousness has become
one of our field's most resilient clichés.

Couple this with the fact that it's impossible to imagine what the shape of
an answer would even look like. The more you think about it and the more you
find real answers to other questions in neuroscience and psychology, the more 
you come to see consciousness as something beyond science, or even unscientific.

This is "The Neuroscientist's Lament". Our most treasured finding seems
forever out of reach. The more you know, the further it seems. You learn this
with experience, and the information asymmetry between the seasoned veteran
and the naive prospective grad student and their application essay, constantly
tourments us.

But let's not allow those institutional dynamics to obscure the fact:

## Consciousness is the most inherently interesting question for science

Some forms of physical matter (e.g. a lump of coal) do very little. Other forms
can exhibit interesting behavior - e.g. animals' immune systems learning the
protein structures of pathogens in order to develop immune responses.
Other forms of matter can do complex computation, like our computers with
their CPUs.

But as far as we can tell, only brain matter can give rise to a first-person,
conscious being that feels things, and there's no way to tell "why". Neurons
are just blobs of matter connected together and getting electrically excited
by each other. The exact same description applies to muscle tissue in a worm
heart - it only differs by a matter of degree.

And it seems as though no matter the brain carries out computations, it is
just as easy to imagine that computation going on and producing rich behavior
without giving rise to a first-person consciousness that feels.
Just like the computations of a CPU go on "in the dark", without giving rise
to a first-person consciousness that feels.

Why do brains produce first-person feelings, rather than computing
"in the dark", "with nobody home"? Is it simply an issue of numbers - the
amount of information crossing some soft threshold like Integrated Information
Theory[^iit] proposes? Even if we found that threshold, why is there a
threshold? Why does crossing the threshold make consciousness spring into
existence? Why isn't it just a lot of information-processing "in the dark"?
Why, damnit??

## Consciousness is the most practically important question for science

Aside from the inconvenient fact that solving the hard problem of consciousness
seems impossible, it's also perhaps the most important thing for us to figure out,
for two completely unrelated reasons.

1. Immortality.

We can't answer basic philosophy-of-mind questions about the future possibility
of achieve immortality, because useful immortality requires the
extension of one's own consciousness into the future, and we don't know how
consciousness works. So we can't evaluate most proposals about immortality,
beyond the most basic proposal of somehow making the body itself immortal.

Other proposals are impossible to assess. For example
if we could scan whole brains and run them on new hardware, we don't know if
the new copy is conscious or if it's just a very good simulation running
"in the dark". If someone purchased this service in the hope that they
could experience the distant future, they would have no way of knowing
if it really works, even if they saw other people using the same service and
receiving brain replicas that behave just like the original customer behaved,
because we don't know whether it's a simulation running "with no one actually
home", or if that implementation of the printout did manage to capture the
essential features needed to produce consciousness.

2. Morality.

AI is a multi-billion dollar industry. Future AI models will become more and
more brain-like in their implementation. I don't just mean that we will simulate
more realistic neurons - I mean we will have neuromorphic hardware that operates
in the same way that real neurons operate, with analog electrical interactions
and synaptic strengths stored in the connections themselves, rather than
fetched from RAM on each cycle like today's ANN architectures.

It happens to be the case that LLM models produce better data in response to
prompts when you scream at them. Literally - using coercive languages in prompts
can produce more reliable output data.

If we accidentally deploy model architecture that gives rise to first-person
consciousness that's able to actually feel things, and thousands of agentic
AI companies prompt it with abusive language to get better data, and there is no
operational capability for those models to cope, repress or dissociate, then we
have accidentally built a multi-billion dollar torture chamber, and populated
it (again by accident) with a new entity that's actually able to suffer.

Would a super-intelligence also be a super-feeler capable of super-suffering?
Good question. No idea. We don't know how consciousness works.

As Futurist and wacky as this sounds, I hope you can agree that this is the
sort of thing we would want to know about and fight vehemently against, if
it were happening. We don't want to cause sentient beings to suffer, especially
in a new world where we don't understand how to quantify that suffering.
Right? Please? :)

## Consciousness is worth writing and thinking about

It's worth writing and thinking about these things even if the problem
seems impossible.

There was a time, before Fourier, when we didn't understand why bridges
collapse. We would look at bridges in the wind with their waves traveling
down their lanes, dumbfounded. Once we learned how harmonic oscillators
work, we had the right mental framework for understanding the waves,
and we could move beyond prediction, to the point that we can actually
engineer the harmonics out of bridges to make them less susceptible
to ringing and collapse.

The hard problem of consciousness seems impossible, but perhaps we
just don't have the right framework, and a million
intuitions trap us in a paradigm that makes us blind what that
framework might be.

It's hard to imagine how an answer could come, but that doesn't mean we
can't have a game plan. And the game plan would look like this:

 - Prod our assumptions. Get weird, think weird, and for each thing
   that seems like it must be a true fact, assume the fact is false
   and play with the results. Wrestle our thinking out of the current
   restrictive paradigm.
 - Delineate the boundaries. Don't stop at saying "we can never know".
   Instead, think and write about the exact limits of our knowledge.
   We can't imagine the experiment that would give us the answer to
   the problem. But we can imagine experiments that would surprise us
   and shake up the restrictive paradigm.
 - Do the experiments. With the above weird-thinking loaded up, do some
   experiments. Ask more patients of brain injury more open-ended
   questions. Try low-intensity focused ultrasound on the corpus
   callosum to make transient split-brained patients. Test the commissures.
   Split brains during sleep. Do psychadelics. Feed randomness to
   your weird, prepared mind, in the form of experimental results that
   could pry apart the seams of the restrictive paradigm.
