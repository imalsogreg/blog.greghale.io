    <div class="post-content"><p>In April 2019, I came down with a nasty case of vertigo. The acute phase lasted
a month, and after that it would come and go, never reaching the original peak
but also never recovering fully. After a long journey with several specialists,
an otolaryngologist at Johns Hopkins cracked the case, and my Vertigo journey
ended. Mostly. Along the way, I learned a surprising amount of fun science. In
this blog post, I'll share a bit about those learning and how this disease
felt.</p>
<h2 id="the-symptoms">The symptoms</h2>
<p>The main symptom of vertigo is the spinning and dizziness. Being dizzy can be
fun for a while, but of course it gets old quickly. The chronic dizziness of
Vertigo makes it difficult to work or care for kids. Driving was impossible.</p>
<div id="vertigo-simulator"></div>
<p>"<em>Thanks, I hate it</em>" is the correct reaction.</p>
<p>Even when the world was not spinning, my head never felt fully fixed in space.
The sensation is hard to describe - imagine objects in the distance always
vibrating just a little bit.</p>
<p>The last symptom I felt is much harder to describe. It's something like
electrical noise or static. There's no actual sound, though, or any other
feeling I can easily compare it to without sounding a little crazy. Imagine a
beam of television static blasting from a spot at the back, left side of your
head. The doctors didn't say that other Vertigo patients had something similar.
But for me, it came with the Vertigo and left with the Vertigo.</p>
<h2 id="the-inner-ear">The inner ear</h2>
<p>Let's see what broke. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_cell">Hair cells</a> in
the cochlea that are excited by the fluid oscillations caused by sound waves,
letting us hear. The vestibular organs contain the same type of cell responding
to a different fluid movement - the movement of fluid rotating in the
semicircular canals in response to head rotation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019-12-20-britannica.jpg" alt="Vestibular organs: https://www.britannica.com/science/utricle" /></p>
<p>The <em>semicircular canals</em> are
large enough to see in an MRI scan. If you'd like to see <em>my</em>
semi-circular canals, feast your eyes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019-12-20-canalsMRI.jpg" alt="My MRI Brain scan, Mercy Neurology department" /></p>
<p>To detect static head orientation, we need to make use of gravity. In the inner
ear, we see these same cells again, now embedded in jelly and capped by heavy
calcium crystals called <em>otoconia</em>. As a head tilts one way or the other,
these crystals shift their position, activating sets of hair cells sensitive to
that particular tilt.</p>
<h2 id="trouble-in-inner-ear-paradise">Trouble in inner-ear paradise</h2>
<p>There is no physical barrier between the otoconia crystals in their jelly, and
the fluid of the semicircular canals.</p>
<p>Like any open office plan, this setup has problems. The otoconia crystals
sometimes dislodge from their jelly and float into the semicircular canal. The
heavy crystals interfere with the motion of the fluid in the canals during head
rotation, producing out-of-whack rotation signals.</p>
<h2 id="one-weird-trick">One weird trick...</h2>
<p>Here is an idea so crazy that it just might work. We know the shapes of the
semicircular canals, we know where otoconia are supposed to live, and we know
that otoconia fall under the influence of gravity. Maybe we could rotate the
head through a series of positions to guide the otoconia back to their jelly?</p>
<p>One of my complaints about science is that our elegant models tend to fall over
in the face of real world complexity. But in this case, the model does work, and
a large number of Vertigo cases can be cured exactly this way. That's one of the
things I was most delighted by in this whole journey.</p>
<p>Loose crystals from one sensory organ tresspassing into the working end of
another sesnory organ is a simple model. What made my vertigo story so
delightful to me was the way the model works in practice, to suggest a cure that
requires no drugs or prolonged therapy. The treatment is called the Epley
Maneuver.</p>
<p>If (a) crystals can get into the semicircular canals, (b) this cause problems
when crystals move and interfere with fluid sensors and (c) the shapes of the
canals are well known, then perhaps by rotating the head a certain way we could
coax the crystals back through the canals and into the utricle where they
belong, a bit like the toy with a marble navigated through a maze on a balance
board you control with knobs?</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019-12-20-lucky-labrynth.jpg" alt="Lucky Labrynth" /></p>
<p>Well, for that subset of vertigo cases where loose crystals are the cause, it
does work. And one has to wonder, when Epley first tried it successfully, was
this a Eureka! moment for him, or with total confidence in the crystal
hypothesis did he shrug the maneuver's success off as trivial.</p>
<p>When the right side (most commonly, the hindmost of the three canals) is the
problem, the crystals tend to settle at a low point in the ring, and we want to
get them around the top of the ring and back into the utricle. The maneuver goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sit straight up</li>
<li>Turn the head 45 degrees to the right</li>
<li>Keeping the turn, lay back fairly quickly, letting the head hang below the sholders</li>
<li>After the nystagmus subsides, remain lying down and turn the head toward the opposite side</li>
<li>After the next wave of nystagmus subsides, roll onto your left side, keeping your
head turned toward your left shoulder</li>
<li>After the next wave of nystagmus subsides, lift your body to a sitting position</li>
</ul>
<p>To see why this works, try the procedure on the model head below. The model
has two loose crystals in his right canal. The controls are tricky, but if you
get the sequence right, they will land on the green "utricle" and be stable
there as long as the head stays upright.</p>

<p>If the head can bec back to the upright position without the red crystals
falling back down, you win!</p>
<h2 id="feels">Feels</h2>
<p>As you can see in the simulation, when the head is still, gravity brings the
crystals to their lowest location. A few minutes after lying down in bed, things
in the inner ear are settled down. The fluid motion sensors are not being
activated. Everything feels back to normal.</p>
<p>Being still in bed is so comfortable, in fact, that you can start to wonder if
the whole condition is clearing up and you can go back to normal activities
soon. But, for quite some time, sitting up very reliably brings back the vertigo
and all the discomfort. This ends up training you not to leave the bed, to spend
a long time after waking up in an anxious state, temporarily cured and hoping
that you will still be ok when you get up, but knowing that probably won't
happen. It's emotionally hard, and during this episode, I gained a ton of
sympathy for people with chronic illness.</p>
<h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
<p>Here is a rough breakdown of the medical care I received, with the cost after insurance.</p>
<p>Date        Center                  Cost</p>
<hr />
<p>2019-06-02  Urgent Care             $150
2019-06-02  Union Memorial Hospital $800
2019-06-20  Mercy Otolaryngology    $100
2019-07-20  Mercy Neurology         $150
2019-08-02  Mercy Radiology         $150
2019-12-03  Hopkins Otolaryngology  $100</p>
<p>The first two trips happened because the dizziness came on so strongly that my
wife and I thought there may be a serious issue. Urgent Care also didn't want to
rule anything out, and they urged us to go to the ER (it was fairly late at
night, and I couldn't reach my family physician).</p>
<p>I was perscribed nausea medicine and told that I probably had viral
labrynthitis, which should resolve itself it 3 to 14 days. While the strongest
phase did die down after a couple of weeks, I had the residual feelings
mentioned above. They could come and go, maybe once a month I had a week of
symptoms.</p>
<p>So I kept seeing other specialists. An otolaryngologist at Mercy Medical agreed
that it was viral labrynthitis and prescribed low-dose valium and waiting. We
decided not to take the valium - due to the wait times before our visits, the
visit tended to happen on the tail end of a bout of vertigo, and I was scared of
taking anything psychoactive when the symptoms were subsiding anyway.</p>
<p>The trip to Mercy Neurology was recommended because of the stranger symytoms I
mentioned above. The nails-on-the-board, the beam of corrupt information - these
things hinted that there may be something wrong with my noodle. But the battery
of tests didn't turn up anything, and my MRI scans looked normal.</p>
<p>In summary, the treatment from June through August was kind and caring, but
didn't make much progress in clearing up the symptoms.</p>
<h3 id="the-fix">The Fix</h3>
<p>As it happens, my wife studied the neurons of the vestibular system<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#xpl2016">1</a></sup>
and the hair cells of the utricle<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#xpl2016b">2</a></sup> in her doctoral and postdoc labs,
which were hospital-affiliated. She managed to use some of her connections to
get me an appointment at Johns Hopkins Otolaryngology. I'll add that she did
this without much help from me - in a typical partners dynamic, I was resistent
to seeing more doctors after having had so little success in the past.</p>
<p>I'm grateful she did, though. Becuase the doctor I saw, Yuri Agrawal, finally
diagnosed the issue and solved it during the office visit with the Epley
maneuver.</p>
<p>I noticed the impact when I left the office and got into my car. I was between
episodes at the time - I thought that I felt mostly fine, not dizzy. In truth, I
had adapted to much of the vertigo. And after the treatment, all of the residual
symptoms that I had gotten used to disappeared. I felt like I could perfectly
focus on distant points. I could move my head around quickly and easily focus on
several objects a second (during a dizziness episode, I couldn't drive; between
episodes, I drove rigidly, giving myself lots of extra time before making turns,
since it took longer for me to look around at all the surroundings). The general
sense of "displacement" was gone. It had been 5 months since I started feeling
bad, and now, I felt like I had super-powers. There was a lot of happy giggling
on my solo drive home from Hopkins Medical.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dr. Agrawal!</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This blog post may sound like medical advice. I really want to emphasize - I'm not
a doctor. I have no idea how common BPPV is compared to other causes of vertigo,
so I have no idea how likely the Epley maneuver is to work for you if you're
having vertigo. Talk to a doctor.</p>
<p>During my visit with Dr. Agrawal, which had the fast pacing of a doctor who
leads a dual life as head of a research lab, she explained some of the inner ear
biology that kicked off my exploration, and recommended I look up Richard
Rabbitt, who has done really interesting physical simulation<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#rabbitt">3</a></sup> of the Epley
maneuver.</p>
<p>There are a lot of inaccuracies in my simulation. To get a much better (though
not interactive) view of how and why the Epley Maneuver works. You can also meet
Dr. John Epley himself!<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#epley_youtube">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I wanted to share my story, and to try out some ideas that had gotten into my
head (the vertigo simulator and the interactive Epley model above), in the
context of this unpleasant episode in my life.</p>
<p>One takeaway - there can be light at the end of the tunnel, and sometimes
although a partner's involvement in your medical choices can feel a little
overbearing, they may often be right. As I tearfully told her after my
treatment, since I'm naturally reluctant to see doctors, if she hadn't been so
persistent then I might have gone the rest of my life with on-and-off BPPV.</p>
<h2 id="one-year-later">One Year Later</h2>
<p>Since I wrote this posts, a year passed. I'm sad to say that the Epley
maneuver wasn't the end of my Vertigo story. I had 3 more bouts of Vertigo,
spaced about two months apart, and leasting for 1 or 2 weeks. Strangely,
each episode was followed by strong hearing loss in my left ear. Further
trips to Hopkins Otolaryngology lead to no clear diagnosis. My symptoms
resemble either Menier's Disease, BPPV, or vestibular migraine at different
times.</p>
<p>To try to get a diagnosis, I've been tracking my food, stress and sleep.
It seems like sleep deprivation, alcohol or alcohol consumption may be a
triggers. I would like to narrow it down, but I recently started a new job
and I'm reluctant to do the right experiments to bring on vertigo episodes
that interfere with my work and my ability to drive my family around.</p>
<p>On the bright side, now that I'm avoiding all the possible triggers that I'm
aware of, it's been 6 months since I've had an episode.</p>
